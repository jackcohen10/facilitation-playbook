      "name": "End of Year Reflection Exercises\ncompiled by AGK\nFrom Alisa Cohn: \nGo through my calendar and note the things that brought me the most joy, and the most aggravation. (It actually takes only about an hour - don\u2019t be intimidated! Also it's kind of fun to re-live your year.)\nBased on the \u201cjoy list\u201d and \u201caggravation list,\" write down the \u201cdo more of\u201d and \u201cdo less of\u201d to help get more of the first and less of the second. \nFinally, I riff on my goals for next year, but more importantly I write down the process I\u2019m going to use to achieve them. For example, every year I assign myself something new to learn about. This year I plan to learn more about DAOs; so my process will be to devote at least an hour a week dedicated to studying them and - probably - coaching inside of them.\n\nFrom Holly Woods: \n- Get curious. How do you currently see yourself? What are your beliefs\nabout who you are and what you\u2019re made of? What beliefs do you hold? All\nbeliefs are limiting. What do yours signify about who you imagine you are?\nHow does that limit your identity? Your perception of the world?\n- Stand outside yourself. Serve as a witness to your life, your beliefs,\nand all the \u201cstuff\u201d of your life. Who would you be without all that? How\nmight a wider perspective, or less stuff, create freedom and openness?\n- Detach. Let go. Relinquish the beliefs. The stuff. The people or\nrelationships. The roles. Anything you believe to be absolutely necessary\nfor who you are\u2026. It likely creates rigidity that will keep you from\nbecoming what\u2019s next.\n- Grieve. Letting go is hard. The most painful grieving you\u2019ll ever do\nis when you commit suicide on the inside. All those beliefs, and all that\nstuff that you acquired to create a veneer for that identity, do not\ncomprise who you are, just who you thought you were.\n- Allow the space. Before you go filling it again, let your space be\nempty for a bit. Don\u2019t decide who you\u2019re going to become before you have a\nchance to feel the relief of not knowing. The sheer delight of anticipating\nwhat is to come.\n- Notice what's emerging. Be on the lookout for clues of what\u2019s wanting\nto emerge (here\u2019s a list of purpose KPIs\n<http://email.v.kajabimail.net/c/eJxlUM1qxCAYfJr1UgzxJ4kePLS0hZ77AMHVLxu7iYqaDXn7JrstFArfYT6GGWYGZu2mvmwR1NsBX1LQ1uhcENwZZxUlXDQt5U2HRmWpODdcDlQQaAgjnJuhJpy2wAxr5ICyK_Cj6rhgoiZoUmMpMZ_Y84m-7zeGadrWEGyOo61msG6ZKxPmO7ViG_AWFnz1O15H8MeXAE_u5vwFB4_jkmLIgAl0XHJtOmIJmiFnfYE-g7eQehv2-F7dqqv-0md3dKk8_LaysLtB2o6gDRGt6GjbMeQUrSkhlBEiOSG8kmdhJANbU1O3QsKJ1_8ck9LeJlh37gEu16MMKupzn-Lp4_VE2Z8xdIy91zOohw3OJSQYUvAl45iCXUxxwSOr6sFYyb4BxFKI8Q>\nto help you identify them.) You\u2019ll see the signs and indicators of what\nwants to come in as you welcome possibilities.\n- Celebrate. You can\u2019t really celebrate the new until you\u2019ve released\nthe old. A vow to a new partner means you let go of old flings. The same\ngoes for every area of your life- career, roles, place, friends, identity\u2026.\nLearn to observe and honor the ways you\u2019re relinquishing the old to become\nthe new.\n\nFrom Jo Kent Katz and Sarah Anne Minkin via Lauren Spokane:\nQuestions that help me orient my internal compass:\nwhat do I love?\nwhat do I long for?\nwhat does my work enable me to love?\nwith whom does my work help me get proximate?\nhow does that proximity feed me?\nhow does this work feed me?\nand what do I need to sustain the work?\n\nFrom Ali Schultz at Reboot.io\nAs you enter the dark months, how are you arriving?\nWhat have you been carrying that needs to lie fallow?\nWhat questions are you holding?\nWhat sorts of stillness and rest are you craving or planning for yourself?\nWhat gets in the way of you slowing down?\nWhat feelings arise for you as you consider these dark months ahead?\nWhat boundaries and protections do you need around the holidays?\nWhat do you know about what nourishes you?\n\nFrom Reboot.io\nPast Self - Pop back into the person you were at the beginning of this year:\nWhat are you noticing about this version of you?\nWhat are you most focused on/what has or pulls your attention the most?\nWhat are your challenges and frustrations with work?\nWhat are your thoughts and feelings about your life, company, team, and the work ahead of you?\nPresent Self - Now come back to the present:\nHow are you different now compared to the beginning of this year?\nWhat has shifted for you (or not)?\nWhat possibilities and/or challenges are you aware of now that you weren\u2019t then?\nWho has been an important part of your life/work this year?

Here\u2019s how. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each role, ask:\n\n1) What is the unique value of this role on this team? What should this person be paying attention to that no one else is? What would we miss if this role wasn\u2019t here?\n\n2) On which stakeholders is this role focused? Whom does it serve? Who defines success?\n\n3) What is the most common tension this role puts on team discussions?

      "name": "Cushions (or Chairs) for Collaboration\nby Deborah Rim Moiso for SessionLab (15-30 min)  \nA fun, dynamic game useful for introducing topics related to decision making, conflict resolution, win-win scenarios and the importance of clear communication of goals. \n\nMaterials\nSome cushions\nInstructions\n1. Place a pile of cushions in the middle of the room. The number of cushions should be that of participants divided by 3. I.e. if you have 12 participants, 4 cushions, and so on (can be one cushion more or less, the game will still work). If you do not have cushions you can also use pieces of cloth, or even of paper. \n\n2. Divide participants into three groups. Avoid using competitive language such as \"teams\". Explain that you will give each group separate instructions. You can give them written instructions or go around the three groups and tell each group their task.\n\n3. Instructions are as follows:\nGroup A - Your task is to place all the cushions in a circle.\nGroup B - Your task is for each member of your group to be sitting on a cushion.\nGroup C - Your task is to put all the cushions close to the door (or window, or whatever fixed element of architecture will work well in your space, can be a tree too!)\n4. Say \"Go!\" and enjoy what happens. Don't offer any further explanation. Participants are likely at some point to look at you for advice, you should just encourage them to figure the game out for themselves. If they ask if they can talk, I generally shrug: nobody told them not to!\n\n5. The group will discover the win-win-win solution (Members of group B sitting on the cushions arranged in a circle by the door). How much time this take varies greatly. I have seen groups reach a solution in 2 minutes and others struggle and set up a veritable pillow fight. \n\n6. Congratulate the group and start a debrief. What happened? How did they find the solution? How did the game feel? \n\nFacilitator's notes\n\nIf anyone is uncomfortable with the physical aspect of the game, do invite them to step outside and observe. As with all such games, the key to learning is in the debrief discussion. Here are some points that might emerge:\n\nThe groups started with an assumption that they could not speak to one another or reveal their task (this is often the case). Where did that idea come from, since it was not in the instructions? Is this common in the real world? How would negotiations and discussions change if we shared our objectives?\nThe groups started with an assumption that they would have to compete and fight. Where did that idea come from? Is this common in the real world?\nWhat helped the shift from a win-lose to a win-win mindset? What happened then?\nHow did it feel to reach a solution that worked for everyone? \nBackground\nI am pretty sure I first read about this game on Seeds for Change, I cannot find it there anymore, if you do please let me know the link in the notes and I will add the attribution.

Arrange them in a single stack with the two versions alternating.\nFlow\nDistribute the handout. Give one copy of the handout from the combined stack to each participant. Everyone will assume they have the same handout.\nGive instructions.\u00a0Tell the participants that this is an independent activity. Ask them to read through the problem and pick the best program. Wait 2 minutes for the participants to complete this task.\nCompare the participant's programs.\u00a0Ask the participants how many chose the first (blue) program. Ask how many chose the second (purple) program.\nDebriefing\nDebrief the activity by revealing that you distributed two different versions of the handouts. Point out that the consequences of the programs in blue are the same, and the consequences of the purple in purple are the same. The two groups probably chose opposite programs, because they were framed in different ways.\nExplain that studies show that the participants will pick the first program in the positively framed example that emphasizes lives gained, and the second program in the negatively framed example that emphasizes lives lost.\nConduct the remainder of the debriefing discussion by asking these types of questions:\n\n* What other decisions do we make that may be influenced by framing?\n* What are some examples of how the framing effect is used to manipulate decision making?\n* What can we do to reduce the effects of framing when making a decision?\n\nLearning Points\nWhen presented with parallel options, a decision may be more influenced by the language used (\u201cthe framing effect\u201d) than the actual content.\n\n\nYou work for the Centers for Disease Control and there is an outbreak of deadly disease called \u201cthe Asian Flu\u201d in a town of six hundred people.

On the left, write \u201cleast\u201d; on the right, write \u201cmost.\u201d Pre-create 3-4 Post-its or colored squares per person. Place them off to the side.\n\nTo begin, have everyone type a noun in each of their stickies. Then have one person propose an adjective and add it to the top of the spectrum. (If your adjective is crunchy, your spectrum would be least crunchy on the left to most crunchy on the right.)\n\nAs a group, as fast as you can, collectively sort all the noun stickies along the spectrum of that adjective. (For example, sort all nouns according to where they fall on the scale of least to most hairy, grumpy, or miraculous). Attempting to do it all at once should feel like joyful chaos.\n\nPick out a new adjective and re-sort, reminding folks that anyone can move any Post-it, not just their own. Go through a few rounds until laughs abound.\n\nWhy it works: Prioritizing is a critical and challenging part of convergence. And it is made even harder when the options you are deciding between feel like they exist on diametrically different axes. This warm-up will help you get comfortable in the ambiguity that is comparing apples and oranges (or perhaps even apples and orange shoes).\n\n-IDEO, Olivia Vagelos, https://www.ideo.com/blog/4-warm-ups-to-prime-your-team-for-decision-making?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=94624064&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8VQpsdnwU2ZdRF42lSkoz8psF4cGiJdiJDlyeI-DJFuWuKjwQNJYJb6heikq39waYcnudKIJI50M0ro6K7hCiho23sPtppVT5370Ac5VjS0yfTE2k&utm_content=94624064&utm_source=hs_email\n",

Pair people up and give them 30 seconds to brainstorm and find a new noun that connects what each individual drew (for example, stapler + glass of water = anchor). Have them do this using the chat function on your video call platform. Multiple conversations will be happening in the chat. But don\u2019t worry, that adds a laughable challenge. Once each pair finds their linking noun, have one person sketch it, then go around and share.\n\n\nPairs pairs into quads and have them repeat the process, finding what connects those new things (anchor + lemon = scurvy). Repeat until the collective group has arrived at a single object that has united them entirely. (Hint: like in a game of telephone, this will likely look nothing like any idea anyone started with.)\n\nWhy this works: The way forward may not look like choosing person A\u2019s idea or person B\u2019s. It may require finding a third way that draws from the best of both. This warm-up will help you avoid the Frankenstein compromise, where, rather than making decisions, the team mashes all of the ideas together, and dilutes them all to uselessness in the process. In this exercise, teams practice the skill of looking beyond individual ideas to a higher connecting goal or purpose, and collectively aligning on this new vision.\n\nConvergence can feel heavy. This will bring a bit of levity to the process, allowing your team to find the optimism and energy to build on one another\u2019s ideas moving forward.\n\n-IDEO, Olivia Vagelos, https://www.ideo.com/blog/4-warm-ups-to-prime-your-team-for-decision-making?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=94624064&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8VQpsdnwU2ZdRF42lSkoz8psF4cGiJdiJDlyeI-DJFuWuKjwQNJYJb6heikq39waYcnudKIJI50M0ro6K7hCiho23sPtppVT5370Ac5VjS0yfTE2k&utm_content=94624064&utm_source=hs_email",

We have to somehow make it seem right not to do what we felt we should do. / So we start seeing ourselves (and others) differently.

She approached X\u2019s leadership with an idea based on Mexico\u2019s\u00a0D\u00eda de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. She suggested that the company hold an annual celebration to share stories of pain from defunct projects. Last November, X employees gathered in the main hall to hear testimonials, not only about failed experiments but also about failed relationships, family deaths, and personal tragedies. They placed old prototypes and family mementos on a small altar.

He, she, or ze picks a desired level of intensity for questions: mild, medium, or spicy. Regardless of the intensity level, the focus is welcome to decline answering any question if they don\u2019t feel comfortable doing so, or just aren\u2019t interested in that topic!\n\nMild questions are unlikely to bring up difficult topics or emotions. Examples might be:\n\u27a2 What brings you the most happiness?\n\u27a2 What\u2019s your idea of a perfect day?\n\u27a2 Who in your life would you like to spend more time with?\nMedium questions prompt more vulnerability or deeper thought. Examples:\n\u27a2 How do you feel in this group of people?\n\u27a2 When\u2019s the last time you felt lonely? Why?\n\u27a2 What\u2019s one thing you\u2019d like to change about yourself?\nSpicy questions are anything goes.\n\u27a2 Who in this group are you least comfortable with? Why? \n\u27a2 When\u2019s the last time you had sex?\n\u27a2 How do you feel about your parents\u2019 relationship?\n\u27a2 Do you ever abuse your power?\nAnybody in the group can ask a question at any time. If the person who asked a question feels complete with the answer, at any time, they can say \u201cThank you\u201d, which is a signal for the person on the hot seat to STOP TALKING - even mid-sentence. This ensures that the focus doesn\u2019t ramble, and helps keep the heat up.\n\nGive about 4-10 minutes per person, and aim to end either when the time is up when you feel the high note has been hit. If you want, you can end with group shares of \u201cWhat I get about you is...\u201d and/or \u201cI felt you the most when...\u201d to help ground the experience. The focus chooses who goes next!",

      "name": "USING THE OS CANVAS (from The Ready)\nThe canvas can provoke incredible conversations and powerful stories. It can help you and your team identify what to amplify and what to change.\nIt can even help you find unexpected sources of inspiration. But for your first foray into what can be an emotional and challenging conversation, we recommend a lightly structured workshop format that has proven to be both safe and effective. Here are some brief instructions that will help you on your way.\n\n1. Setup. Reserve a quiet and spacious room with at least one big blank wall or window. Invite your team or a group of no more than fifteen interested participants from across the company. Print out each of the twelve OS Canvas dimensions (available at BraveNewWork.com) and place them on the wall prior to the session. Provide two pads of sticky notes (yellow and green) and a Sharpie for each participant.\n2. Check-in. Ask each participant to \"check in\" to the meeting by answering the following question: What has your attention? Push the group for vulnerability and candor. Model it by checking in first.\n3. Introduction. Introduce participants to the concept of the organiza tional operating system using select passages from our new book, Brave New Work, available at bravenewwork.com.\n4. Tensions. Ask everyone to generate a list of tensions they're feeling day to day based on the following questions: What is preventing you (or your team) from doing your best work? What is slowing you (or your team) down? What is our biggest problem as an organization? Ask each attendee to write down each of their tensions on a yellow sticky note (one per note), with a goal of at least five per person.\n5. Bright spots. Ask everyone to generate a list of the things that are going well based on the following questions: What is working? What is enabling you to do your best work? What is speeding you (or your team) up? What is helping you make better decisions? What are you proud of in terms of the way we work? What is our biggest strength as an organization? Ask each attendee to write down each bright spot on a green sticky note (one per note), with a goal of at least five per person.\n6. Placement. Now have each person place their tensions and bright spots on the canvas where they feel the issue is rooted most strong-ly. As they place each one, have them offer a short explanation to the group. Allow the notion that some tensions belong in multiple dimensions. Allow questions and answers.\n7. Discussion. One dimension at a time, discuss the tensions that were placed on the canvas and identify themes and patterns. As a group, ask yourselves: Why are these issues present now? What underlying structures, rules, or processes are contributing to them? What personal behavior, attitudes, and assumptions are contributing to them? How are the tensions in different dimensions connected? Are there bigger patterns present in the canvas (e.g., we have limited trust, so we reserve all decisions for management, so we have lots of meetings with people asking for permission)?\n8. Sensing, Based on everything you've all heard, ask the group what they would like to change. What one thing would they flip on its head? What addition or subtraction might unlock other possibilities? Capture any intentions or next actions and use them as fodder for your first few loops.",

I set the team goal to deliver 60 meals to foster kids\u2019 shelters. It would take exactly one hour to deliver each meal. The hours connect the purpose to the fear. I then announced that the organization would fire the participants with the most hours. Pretty simple. Isn\u2019t it?\nFor the team to deliver 60 meals, each of the six participants should deliver 10 meals, which will take 10 hours. If they all do so, there wouldn\u2019t be people that spend more hours than others. Nobody would lose their job. Right? It wasn\u2019t that easy. It didn\u2019t work that way for this team or for other teams that have tried this exercise since then.\nHere is how the anonymous poll looked on Zoom.\n \nI put everybody on mute and by the end of the 60 seconds, only half of the participants voted. So I extended by 60 seconds. After a third extension, 5 participants delivered a total of 40 meals (the goal was 60).\n In the conversation afterward, the team agreed that the situation resembled real-life experiences. Delaying deadlines. Missing goals. Slow execution. Difficulties in reaching a project\u2019s finish line. The participants admitted that the fear of losing their job affected their decisions.\nOne participant said she had blacked out when she saw a math problem. The Poll technology overwhelmed another participant. Two participants didn\u2019t scroll down, so they didn\u2019t see the nine and ten options (which I later changed the options to 6-10 meals).

Get the group to adjust their finger heights until the Helium Stick is horizontal and everyone's index fingers are touching the stick.\n\uf0b7 Explain that the challenge is to lower the Helium Stick to the ground.\n\uf0b7 The catch: Each person's fingers must be in contact with the Helium Stick at all times. Pinching\nor grabbing the pole in not allowed \u2010 it must rest on top of fingers.\n\uf0b7 Reiterate to the group that if anyone's finger is caught not touching the Helium Stick, the task will be restarted. Let the task begin....\n\uf0b7 Warning: Particularly in the early stages, the Helium Stick has a habit of mysteriously 'floating' up rather than coming down, causing much laughter. A bit of clever humoring can help \u2010 e.g., act surprised and ask what they are doing raising the Helium Stick instead of lowering it! For added drama, jump up and pull it down!\n  \n  \uf0b7 Participants may be confused initially about the paradoxical behavior of the Helium Stick.\n\uf0b7 Some groups or individuals (most often larger size groups) after 5 to 10 minutes of trying may be inclined to give up, believing it not to be possible or that it is too hard.\n\uf0b7 The facilitator can offer direct suggestions or suggest the group stops the task, discusses their strategy, and then has another go.\n\uf0b7 Less often, a group may appear to be succeeding too fast.\nIn response, be particularly vigilant about fingers not\ntouching the pole. Also make sure participants lower the\npole all the way onto the ground. You can add further difficulty by adding a large washer to each end of the stick and explain that the washers should not fall off during the exercise, otherwise it's a restart.\n\uf0b7 Eventually the group needs to calm down, concentrate, and very slowly, patiently lower the Helium Stick \u2010 easier said than done.\nHow Does it Work?\n\uf0b7 The stick does not contain helium. The secret (keep it to yourself) is that the collective upwards pressure created by everyone's fingers tends to be greater than the weight of the stick. As a result, the more a group tries, the more the stick tends to 'float' upwards.\nProcessing Ideas\n\uf0b7 What was the initial reaction of the group?\n\uf0b7 How well did the group cope with this challenge?\n\uf0b7 What skills did it take to be successful as a group?\n\uf0b7 What creative solutions were suggested and how were they received?\n\uf0b7 What would an outside observer have seen as the strengths and weaknesses of the group?\n\uf0b7 What roles did people play?\n\uf0b7 What did each group member learn about him/herself as an individual?\n\uf0b7 What other situations (e.g., at school, home or work) are like the Helium Stick?\n\uf0b7 More information on Facilitation and creative debrief and processing tools\nReferences\n\uf0b7 Booth Sweeney, L. & D.

For two years the site\u2019s Key Performance Indicators (including revenue, operating profit, value added margin, ROIC, inventory turns, quality, on-time delivery, customer satisfaction, etc.) were the lowest scores compared to 14 other sites in the division. Carmella began applying the Learner/Judger principles in March 2010, holding meetings with the team leaders to explain the concept, giving them reading assignments in Change Your Questions, Change Your Life, and providing weekly group coaching sessions that guided the leaders through the process of using Learner Questions to brainstorm solutions to current challenges. They no longer shot down new ideas based on old assumptions. Instead, they used Learner Questions (instead of Judger statements) to explore potential ways to increase revenue and margins. They asked their customers Learner Questions, and used the insights to create profitable updates to products and services. They asked line managers Learner Questions \u2014 and listened with less judgment \u2014 which led to the design and implementation of new business processes that improved quality and customer satisfaction. There was also a trickle-down effect as the leaders coached their direct reports in how to approach situations with a Learner mindset, creating a learning culture throughout the site. Within three months, the new approach had brought about a turnaround. The site moved to the #1 position in the division (based on the KPI\u2019s) and it consistently remains in the top 3 sites out of 21 sites today.",

For example, you have a question, you list possible answers to those questions to the right, etc. Often, group insights / convergence happen when a group realizes that there's a more fundamental question than the ones they've been trying to answer. That question is placed to the left of the current discussion, hence the term, \"left-hand move.\" To me, the ability to get to these core questions \u2014 i.e. making left-hand moves \u2014 is one of the fundamental qualities of a skillful facilitator / leader.\n--via Eugene Kim, http://fasterthan20.com/wiki/Jeff_Conklin#Lessons_Learned\n",

But you should also consider other metrics important to the project. They may include things like:\n\nSecurity \u2013 what's your tolerance for risk?\nResilience \u2013 how resilient does a new software capability need to be?\nExtensibility \u2013 how important is it to make something that others can contribute to, customize, or extend easily?\nUsability \u2013 how easy to use should your final deliverable be?\nQuality \u2013 considering your customer experience, how high do you set the quality bar?\nDelight \u2013 a bit different from \"quality\"... is it important that your deliverable put a smile on people's faces?\nScalability \u2013 should you design for fast growth and/or large scale adoption?\nPrepare your whiteboard or butcher's paper with one bar for each metric, labeled with a name. These are your scales. Label the ends of each scale with a value: \"most negotiable\" on one end, \"least negotiable\" on the other.\n\nCut your sticky notes in half or thirds to create sets of sliders for each participant to place on the bars. Prepare an additional set of stickies (preferably in a different color) that you'll use as the final agreed-upon slider on each scale.\n\nPRO TIP\nUse a different color sticky note for each person so it's easy for everyone to see (i.e., remember) where they placed their sliders. \n\nSTEP 1\nSet the stage (5 min)\nExplain that your team's goal for the session is to reach consensus on what are the most and least critical aspects of the project.\n\nINTRODUCE THE SLIDERS\nReview the metrics you've decided to weigh, and ask if there are additional metrics you should create scales for.\n\nExplain what \"most\" and \"least\" negotiable means for each metric. For example, if the project is estimated to take 6 weeks and you have a large marketing campaign scheduled, \"least negotiable\" would be time as it's paramount you deliver within 6 weeks, while \"most negotiable\" may be scope, as you drop the nice to haves in order to meet your deadline.\n\nDiscuss briefly which sliders have dependent relationships, and which are independent. Speed, scope, and cost are typically inter-dependent, while usability and scope may not be.\n\nPRO TIP\nAnother way of labeling your scales (from left to right) is: unimportant, desirable, highly desirable, important, critical.\n\nSTEP 2\nSilent voting (5 min)\nSo as not to be biased by the group, have each person write down where they intend to place their sliders on each of the scale.\n\nOnce it looks like everyone has made up their minds, have them place their sliders on the bars. \n\nSTEP 3\nSlide the sliders around (20 min)\nReview the scales one by one, and invite the group to discuss why they placed their sliders where they did and get consensus. You'll probably have to revisit some of the scales and slide the sliders around as your team decides how to balance the relative priorities.\n\nWhen you've reached consensus on all scales, lock in each sliding scale with the \"final\" sliders you prepared (preferably a different color than the sliders each team member placed).\n\nIf using a whiteboard, snap a photo of your scales before cleaning up the room.",

      "name": "Quality Housing-- House of Cards Strategy Game\nYour group will be organized into a construction company producing residential housing. Houses will be constructed from 3 x 5 cards, fastened with cellophane tape and decorated with felt-tip markers.  You will be competing with other companies to attain the highest levels of profitability.  You will work in two phases:\n\nPhase I: Planning.  \nYour team will (a) develop a design for the houses you will produce and (b) plan how you will organize and manage production of houses during Phase II. Whenever you are ready to begin production, inform the instructor, who will give you a starting signal and keep time.\n\nPhase II: Production: \nYour team will have 5 minutes to produce houses. Your only cost is $500.00 for each card which is bent, folded, altered, or used in producing a house or prototype.  You will be charged for any cards that are bent, folded, taped or marked during planning, but such cards may not be used for production. Costs of tape, markers and labor are considered equivalent for all companies, and are ignored. Profit equals total revenues less cost of cards.\n\nThe market will absorb all houses built (so long as they meet the specifications below) at the following prices:\n\nOne story houses:\n\u2022\t$9,000 for first 15 units\n\u2022\t$8,000 for 16th through 25th unit\n\u2022\t$7,000 for any additional units.\n\nTwo story houses:\n\u2022\t$16,000 for first 8 units\n\u2022\t$14,000 for 9th through 16th units\n\u2022\t$12,000 for any additional units\n\nBonuses\n1.\tThe company whose houses are judged to be most attractive, durable and appealing to the customer will receive a quality bonus of 20% of revenues.\n2.\tThe first company to bring houses to market (that is, the company that produces houses first) will received a bonus of 20% of revenues.\n\nNo house may be sold unless it meets the following specifications:\n1.\tCards cannot be cut, but may be bent or folded.  Nothing other than cards, tape and markers may be used in constructing houses.\n2.\tThe main floor must be enclosed on a minimum of three sides.  It must have a floor, a minimum of one door and one window, and an area of not less than 28 sq. inches (two 3 x 5 cards, less allowance for overlap).\n3.\tUpper stories must have a floor and at least two windows.\n4.\tAll houses must have a peaked roof and a chimney.\n5.\tHouses must pass a test of durability: ability to sustain a drop from twelve inches above a hard surface (such as a tabletop) without sustaining damage.\n\nDebrief\nGeneric strategies are easy enough to explain and students typically feel that they understand. But do they really? Could they develop and implement a sound strategy? Sometimes it\u2019s worth a bit of additional hands-on experience to make sure the lessons stick. Probably the most important message is alignment \u2014 the need to design the organization and product to fit the strategy. In other words, to make the appropriate tradeoffs. Lee Bolman offers a very simple house building exercise (out of index cards) that makes these points very nicely. Teams plan what kind of houses they will build and organize their production. Strategies naturally fall into more low cost (simple one story house) or differentiation (complex two story). The 20% quality bonus and 20% first mover bonus help to highlight these competing objectives. This one-page handout describes the rules and process for running the exercise. The debrief focuses on the teams\u2019 strategies and how they organized:\n\uf0a7\tPlanning process \u2014 How did they frame the problem and explore solutions?\n\uf0a7\tCompetitive Dynamics \u2014 A strategy is more likely to be successful if few firms (teams) adopt it. How do they anticipate what rivals will do?\n\uf0a7\tImplementation \u2014 Plans often don\u2019t unfold as expected. A common problem is that when the time is up, they are stuck with inventories of unfinished products.\nOverall, this is a simple and easy to implement exercise that drives home basic strategy and organization issues nicely. The exercise can be run in a little as 75 minutes, though 90 to 120 minutes provides more time for both the exercise and debriefing.  The steps to run the exercise are:\n1.\tProvide materials to teams (2 packs of 3-5 cards, 2-3 rolls of tape, 2-3 markers).\n2.\tDistribute the Quality Housing Instructions.  Briefly introduce the exercise and announce how much time is available for planning (10 min). At the end of the production period, do a count-down from 5 and firmly announce \u201cStop!\u201d.  Teams may be startled when the time is up.\n3.\tOnce teams have produced, have them calculate their expenses, revenue, and net income.  You can check houses against the specifications either immediately after a team produces, or after all teams have produced. If a team produces multiple houses, test a few to see if they can be dropped 12 inches without damage.\n4.\tCollect the financial results from all teams (revenue, costs, net), and award the bonuses for quality and first-to-market.\n\n--Bolman & Deal, http://www.leebolman.com/exercises.htm",

      "name": "Normalize Conflict-- See the Roles\nYou can normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist among them. Here\u2019s how. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each role, ask:\n1) What is the unique value of this role on this team? What should this person be paying attention to that no one else is? What would we miss if this role wasn\u2019t here?\n2) On which stakeholders is this role focused? Whom does it serve? Who defines success?\n3) What is the most common tension this role puts on team discussions? What one thing does the person in this role have to say that frequently makes others bristle?\nAnswer those questions for each member of the team, filling in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. As you go through the exercise, use examples of contentious issues that your team has been stuck on to illustrate these points. Watch the faces light up as they start to realize how their lack of appreciation for this dynamic has caused many of the arguments and hard feelings on the team. Talk about how you\u2019ll use each of these different perspectives as criteria in your decision making from now on.\nOnce you go through this exercise, you\u2019ll see that in the vast majority of cases, when presented with all the information, the team will be able to align around a decision. \n-Liane Davey, HBR, An Exercise to Help Your Team Feel More Comfortable with Conflict",

      "name": "Peer Consult Process (via Richard Wentworth Ping)\n\nPart of the Business Advisory Program will be to include a process called \u201cPeer Consultation\u201d. This process allows one of the team to share a current challenge with the rest of the team and have them consider it, critique your current way of thinking or handling it and offer advice.\n\nIt serves a couple of purposes:\n\n1.\tIt allows the whole team to better understand a challenge that someone on the team has, that they may not otherwise get visibility of. Teams help each other solve problems, even if they are not whole of business problems.\n2.\tIt allows the person with the problem to get a wider range of views and advice than they might normally ask for. It\u2019s not about solving the issue in 30-45 minutes. It\u2019s about a different perspective and hopefully some new ideas.\n3.\tIt provides a process that the team can use at any time in the future to help discuss a challenge. \n\nSo I\u2019d like each of you to consider a current challenge you are facing that you would be willing to share with the team and let them question you on it and then discuss and ideate on it. There are a couple of guidelines for the challenge you decide on:\n\n\u2022\tAvoid challenges that are really too big to be addressed within the time we have (the solving world peace scenario).\n\u2022\tAvoid anything that requires some sort of presentation of complex details. \n\u2022\tMake sure that you are part of the story (in other words it\u2019s not all about other people)\n\u2022\tMake sure it is something that you are genuinely looking for ideas. Giving us a challenge that you have already solved, or already have a range of answers doesn\u2019t engage people.\n\u2022\tClearly frame the question that you would like to group to consider and generate ideas on\n\nHere is the process we will use:\n\n1.\tThe team in the room will be split into two groups, each working on a separate challenge by one person in each group. \n\n2.\tThe person whose challenge is being discussed outlines their challenge as they see it. (5-10 minutes)\n\n3.\tThe group then asks questions of fact and clarification in order to understand the situation and dilemma. The participant answers those questions. Make sure that you fully explore what the person has already tried in terms of solving the problem and what the results were. This avoids the group coming up with ideas that get rejected as \u201calready tried\u201d. Although their implementation of a previous idea may have been flawed. (10 minutes)\n\n4.\tThe group then discusses the challenge while individual remains silent (no comments). It is vital here that the group is totally honest about what they have heard, what they think and how they view how the person\u2019s behaviour. It is important the person hears \u201cthe truth\u201d from others perception. Always do this with positive intent. (individual remains silent) (15-20 minutes).\n\n5.\tThe group then generates possible strategies for responding to challenge. (individual remains silent) (15-20 minutes).\n\n1.\tThe individual then finishes the process by summarising what he/she has heard and what has struck them in particular, including what beliefs and assumptions might have been brought into question. (5-10 minutes)\n\nSo the whole process usually takes 60 minutes.",

A second human spectrogram follows which maps participants\u2019 comfort level. Participants are now divided into small groups of 6-8 people, each group sharing a round table covered with flip chart paper and plenty of colored markers. The group members are then asked to individually mindmap their problem on the paper in front of them. Each participant in turn then has the same amount of time to explain his or her problem or challenge to the others at the table and receive advice and support. For a public group evaluation, two final human spectrograms map the shift in comfort level of all the participants and the likelihood that participants will try to change what they\u2019ve just shared.\n\nMinimum resources Enough round tables seating 6-8 people for every participant to have a seat. Flip chart paper that completely covers the tables, a plenty of colored markers at each table Sufficient clear space in the room to hold a one-dimensional human spectrogram for all participants\n\nVia Adrian Segar, Created at the Meeting Professionals Int'l Read the rest of this article, with video links, at: https://www.conferencesthatwork.com/index.php/promo/2012/03/the-solution-room-a-powerful-conference-session/\n\nRead the rest of this article at: https://www.conferencesthatwork.com/index.php/promo/2012/03/the-solution-room-a-powerful-conference-session/",

If your radiation source person touches you, you are dead and out of the game. You must freeze in place. Give each participant about fifteen seconds to silently pick a radiation source. Stress that it is important that no one knows if they have been picked. In practice, almost everyone will be simultaneously a person trying to avoid radiation and a source of radiation for someone else. After everyone has made his or her selection, stress that here should be no running or pushing during the game. Count down \u201c1, 2, 3, Go!\u201d and let the players start moving around.

Invite participants to think big and bold and discover the most attractive of their ideas together by asking, \u201cIf you were ten times bolder, what big idea would you recommend? What first step would you take to get started?\u201d)\n2. Then people mill around and cards are passed from person to person. \"Mill and Pass only. No reading.\" \n3.

(1 for low and 5 for high) and write it on the back of the card\n6. When the bell rings, cards are passed around a second time \"Mill and Pass\" until the bell rings and the \"Read and Score\" scoring cycle repeats. This is done for a total of five scoring rounds. \n7. At the end of cycle five, participants add the five scores on the back of the last card they are holding. Finally, the ideas with the top ten scores are identified and shared with the whole group. 3 min.\n\nTips: \nDemonstrate one exchange-and-scoring interaction using a sample index card to clarify what is expected during the milling, namely no reading of the cards, only passing the cards from person to person so that each person has one and only one card in hand. The process can be confusing for some people. 2 min.\nInvite each participant to write a big idea and first step on his or her card. 5 min.\nConduct five 3-minute exchange-and-scoring rounds with time for milling (and laughing) in between. 15 min.\nAsk participants to add the 5 scores on the back of the card they are holding\nFind the best-scoring ideas with the whole group by conducting a countdown. Ask, \u201cWho has a 25?\u201d Invite each participant, if any, holding a card scored 25 to read out the idea and action step. Continue with \u201cWho has a 24?,\u201d \u201cWho has a 23\u201d\u2026.

It's important to mix up the loves/hates on both pieces of paper so that one is not \"love-heavy\" and the other \"negative\". We went through category by category where everyone goes and puts their sticky on the page that reflects their work style and then at the end processed through each category and gave people the chance to elaborate on their responses (some people would write comments on their sticky note to explain their answer more.)

After a lengthy discussion, we asked each team member to use Pigeonhole Live, a polling solution offered by a Singaporean company, on his or her smart phone to anonymously enter the  percent of next year\u2019s profits that they thought the firm should invest in new growth innovation (our firm Innosight uses Pigeonhole Live but has no formal relationship with the company). After the votes were cast, we displayed the data (waiting to unveil the votes helps to combat groupthink) as a word cloud, with numbers that had multiple votes appearing larger.\n\nA summarized report would have shown that the average was 10 percent, with a standard deviation of four percent. But we were more interested in the outliers, which ranged from two to 20. We asked the people who submitted the lowest and highest numbers to reveal themselves and state their case for the extreme ends of investment.\n\nWe didn\u2019t tell people in advance that we would put them on the spot, but the outliers immediately and voluntarily spoke up...The key is to make clear that the goal isn\u2019t to make a decision (that comes later), but to surface and share misalignment.

      "name": "Listening Self-Assessment & Other Assessment\nInstructions: The Self-Assessment offers an opportunity to take a brief look at where you place your attention when interacting with others. (Answers may be quite different for various situations (school, social, home, work); answer for one or make separate columns for those you would like to assess.) Answer Yes or No beside each of the following questions.\n1.\tI like to multi-task and think about other things when people are talking.\n2.\tIf people aren\u2018t going to take my advice, they shouldn\u2018t waste my time telling me their problems.\n3.\tI\u2018m usually bored when the conversation doesn\u2018t center around my interests.\n4.\tWhen someone is slow to get a point across, I interrupt to get things moving.\n5.\tWhen people speak to me, they most often have to compete with a number of distractions.\n6.\tI tend to be involved in a lot of misunderstandings.\n7.\tA person\u2018s appearance, grammar, or style of speaking affect how much attention I give them.\n8.\tI have trouble keeping a confidence.\n9.\tI usually feel that making my case is more important that someone else\u2018s feelings.\n10. When I don\u2018t understand something, I will often fake it and smile instead of asking questions.\n11. I\u2018m good at looking like I\u2018m listening when I\u2018m not. Most people don\u2018t notice.\n12. I tend to talk when I should be listening. \n13. I trust my intuition and it serves me well. \n14. I can usually tell when people aren\u2018t being honest with me. \n15. I am good at soothing conflict situations and finding win-win solutions.\nListening Education 2/2010 \u00a9 International Listening Association, www.listen.org\nYes/No\n26\nSelf-Assessment Scores: A perfect score would be No to questions 1-12 and Yes to 13-15. If you answered Yes for any number from 1-12, look at these as areas you might want to strengthen. As you place your attention on those areas and make small shifts, notice any subtle changes in your relationships. If you answered No to most of them and Yes to questions 13-15, you have some solid listening foundations. If your answers show areas that you wish to improve, not to worry. You have already begun the process by assessing where you are now and will continue to strengthen these skills as you continue to place your attention on listening.\nAdditional Self-Assessment Questions: Ask yourself:\n1.\tWhat are my listening strengths?\n2.\tWhat are my listening challenges?\n3.\tHow will improving my listening skills improve my personal and/or business relationships?\n4.\tDo I listen to my own intuition? When I have, has it guided me well?\nListening Assessment #2: QUESTIONS OF PERCEPTION\nInstructions: This is a chance to find out how others would rate your listening skills. Give this to people in your life (and ask for honest opinions). Many of the questions mirror the ones in the Self-Assessment, so this is a chance to see if the perceptions of others match your own. No one person\u2018s perception equals reality, but learn how your listening skills are perceived\u2014and be open to thinking about whether someone has a good point.\nDoes this \u2015listener...\n1.\toften multi-task or seem distracted when you are talking?\n2.\tbecome annoyed when you don\u2018t take his/her advice?\n3.\tseem bored when the conversation doesn\u2018t center around his/her interests?\n4.\tfrequently interrupt?\n5.\tallow interruptions or distractions (such as taking calls) when you wish he/she wouldn\u2018t?\n6.\tseem to be involved in a lot of misunderstandings (with you and/or others)?\n7.\tseem to allow a speaker\u2018s appearance, grammar or style of speaking to affect how much attention he/she will give that person?\n8.\tshow that he/she can be trusted to keep a confidence? \n9.\tbulldoze over others\u2018 feelings to make a point? \n10. show genuine interest and ask questions when discussing issues that are complex or especially important to you? \n11. ever seem to be pretending to listen? \n12. seem impatient and quick to draw conclusions? \n13. tend to talk when he/she should be listening?\nAdditional Questions of Perception: These questions would also be helpful to discuss with those who take your Questions of\nPerception assessment.\n1.\tAsk your friends/family/coworkers/classmates:\no\tDo you consider me a good listener? Why/Why not?\no\tCan you tell me about a time when you felt I wasn\u2018t listening? What did you need from me that you didn\u2018t get (emotional support, empathy, an action, a reaction, advice, etc.)?\nReviewing Questions of Perception: A perfect score of the numbered questions would be Yes to questions 8 and 10 and No to all others. Review all answers carefully and ask follow- up questions. Compare answers with your own self-assessment and consider areas that do not match. You might learn things about how others perceive you that are encouraging, and you might learn of areas you need to strengthen, or even that people notice more than you think they do. Make notes on the feedback you receive and check back with the same people as you progress on your listening journey.\nReferences:\nDiamond, Linda Eve (2007). Rule # 1: Stop Talking!

There were also colorful pipe cleaners, ribbon, stickers, crayons, yarn and construction paper. I was immediately intimidated but noticed others began handling the objects before we even had our assignment. Our instructions were to build a model that we felt represented current ideas about leadership. After working for a few minutes on this model we were then asked to change the model to one that represented where we thought leadership thinking needed to be. In building our new model we were supposed to identify the things that challenge and support this change themselves (LLC: Modeling Exercise: Exploring Complex Questions While Having Fun)",

And not what society, family, and your upbringing has projected onto you as what your values *should* be.\n- If done properly, articulating specific resonant values will be actionable in helping you prioritize how you should spend your time to feel more alive/fulfilled.\n- You can also use this exercise to articulate romantic partner values you have, friend values, work values, etc. The below example will walk you through holistic life values but this can be retro-fitted to other categories if that's your intention.\n\n### STEP 1\n\n**1:** Write down as many peak experiences you can think of (at least 15-20). (in recent year or years)\n\n[What is a peak experience?](https://www.notion.so/What-is-a-peak-experience-f0492be18c9d4dddbc7532224fb03bfb)\n\n**2:** Write down specific details of what contributed to it being a peak experience for you. What specifically made this such a special experience? Dig and dig and dig until you have specific words and descriptive phrases to articulate what made that moment so special.\n\n- ***EXAMPLE**  from Catherine (Click on carrot triangle toggle to expand):*\n    \n    <aside>\n    \ud83d\udca1 For the record - this process could take hours over the course of a few days. I remember spending a few hours over dinner one night doing 2021 highlights and then the next evening recalling times from 2020.\n    \n    </aside>\n    \n    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a9c62467-125e-40bc-a782-c73d602e6c4b/pe-1.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a9c62467-125e-40bc-a782-c73d602e6c4b/pe-1.jpg)\n    \n    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0e4022a5-22e0-4fd2-9caf-e40ffeb0d5c9/p-e-2.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0e4022a5-22e0-4fd2-9caf-e40ffeb0d5c9/p-e-2.jpg)\n    \n\n### STEP 2\n\n**1:** Repeat Step 1 for non-peak experiences (at least 10). (in recent year or years)\n\n- Moments/ specific situations that you experienced intense visceral negative feelings or a memorable \"low\". Again, specificity is key.\n- Remember, non-peak experiences are helpful because something you value is being really stomped on in that moment. Esp in situations that spark an intense negative reaction on your end. The trick is to uncover what the specific value is that is being stomped on.\n\n### STEP 3\n\n1: Start to synthesize any themes and patterns you are noticing from these reflections. \n\n- Note: You might have a really long list to start with. That's ok. Just write down any specific patterns you are noticing. This is not going to be your final list, just your first pass at extrapolating SPECIFIC themes you are noticing. Yes, it might look and feel like a lot of chicken scratch.\n- ***EXAMPLE**  from Catherine (Click on carrot triangle toggle to expand):*\n    \n    <aside>\n    \ud83d\udca1 You can blow the picture up if text is too small - by hovering on top right corner and clicking on \"Original\"\n    \n    </aside>\n    \n    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4cf0b3a5-abe3-4de6-be1b-fa5a2f9c6669/syn-1.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4cf0b3a5-abe3-4de6-be1b-fa5a2f9c6669/syn-1.jpg)\n    \n\n### STEP 4\n\n**1:** Synthesize further into a smaller list of values (recc < 7-8 max)\n\n- Remember - be specific. The wording of the value also doesn't have to make sense to anyone except for yourself.\n- Force rank and prioritize them! Even if they all feel important, rank them to what feels true for you.\n- Write down the **goal** of why that value is important to you.\n- Write down **practical specific things** you do (or want to do) to cultivate/live into that value\n- ***EXAMPLE** - Catherine's 7 Values (click on carrot triangle toggle to expand):*\n    \n    **Physical/ Spiritual/ Emotional Health for Grounding + Clean Energy (Self)**\n    \n    - ***Goal:** Feel grounded. Embodied Presence. Feel strong + clean internally. Connecting with universe to allow for intuition to emerge.*\n    - **Practical:** Morning routing - Workout, 30-60 min daily meditation, Journaling 2x/day, Eating gut-healthy meals\n    \n    **Cultivating Possibilities for Magic & Synchronicity (Self)**\n    \n    - ***Goal:** Manifest and call in people, opportunities, experiences, and energy to live and feel my best life + magic of the universe. Feel the absolute  highest joy and excitement of being human.*\n    - **Practical:** Affirmations, Visualizations, Checking Mindset Daily, Planting Seeds, Spontaneous Actions (purely on a whim/gut), Group Experiences, Exploring New Places (esp in nature), Feeling Awe and Inspired, Cultivating spaciousness in schedule of \"nothing\" time\n    \n    **Creative Expression of Soul Truths (External)**\n    \n    - ***Goal:** Integrate learnings and truths more deeply into my sense of self. Express all the overflowing gems in my soul to help myself and (hopefully others too - icing on the cake!)*\n    - **Practical:** Art, Writing, Newsletter, Social Media Sharing\n    \n    **Meaningful, Playful, Joyful, Deep Friendships & Connections (External)**\n    \n    - ***Goal:** Feel soul-nourishment, support, love, and connection with others. Share beautiful experiences and joy with others. Show up for friends. Be the luck in other people's lives.*\n    - **Practical:** Conversations, Shared Experiences, Intentional/Proactive Messaging, Showing up, Checking-In\n    \n    **Learning for Expansive Perspectives + Personal Growth (Self)**\n    \n    - ***Goal:** Expand my soul and mental models for how the world works. Reach deeper understanding and truths about why people act, behave the way they do. Go deeper with myself so I can go deeper and offer more to clients. And to be the best version of me.*\n    - **Practical:** Reading, Conversations, Classes, Workshops, Existing Coach Mastermind trainings, Coaching/Therapy sessions\n    \n    **Evoking Transformation + Alignment in Others (External)**\n    \n    - ***Goal:** Help others feel more alive and aligned in their lives. Gift that keeps on giving. Help others have ripple effects in their lives and on the world. Serve others!*\n    - **Practical:** Coaching, Group Coaching + Trainings, Friend Conversations, Teaching, Encouragement/Check-In messages with friends\n    \n    **Cultivating Flow in every day life (workflow + physical spaces) (Self)**\n    \n    - ***Goal:** Feel a foundational flow with my routines and physical space. Feeling comfort, spaciousness, safety, and grounding that allows for me to be at ease and let the creativity flow in work and personal life. Feeling free to do whatever I want whenever I want.*\n    - **Practical:** Grounding Physical Spaces, Routine Structure, Discipline, Outlet for Admin Tasks, Having $$ means to freely do what I want\n\n**2:** Check-in with yourself at some cadence (monthly or quarterly) on how much (0-10) you feel aligned and living into your values. Write down one practical thing you can do to increase that score. \n\n- Your values must be specific enough to be actionable. The goals you set for yourself in any given month or quarter should be rooted into a value that you have that you want to increase your alignment living into that value. If you're feeling off one day, you should be able to look at your values and articulate which value was stomped on that made you feel off.\n- ***EXAMPLE**  - Catherine's Value Alignment Tracker (click on carrot triangle toggle to expand)*\n    \n    ## VALUE ALIGNMENT TRACKER\n    \n    [How aligned am I living into my values?](https://www.notion.so/bfb54d2ca5ee41bb8570266c5f007756)",

They should be well-rested and not hungry, angry, tired, or feeling lonely or otherwise distressed. Individuals should complete this activity when they are in a quiet, positive, contemplative, and curious state of mind. \nInstructions \nJudger Moment\nConsider times when you have been in a \u201cJudger\u201d mindset. These are times when your thinking has been closed and damaging. Perhaps you have been highly inflexible and blamed yourself and/or others for the horrible situation in which you found yourself. You may have wondered what was wrong with you and wrong with other people. Your mind was filled with criticism. \nWrite down - what was your inner voice telling you about yourself, others, and the situation? \n\nRisks for You\nNow, write down what the risks were for you. What was the risk to yourself if the worst thing happened? Were these risks physical? Psychological? Risks to your status? Risks to your self-image? What could have gone wrong for you, even if the likelihood was small? What were you most worried about? \n\nRisks for Others\nWhat were the risks to other people? If things went wrong in this difficult situation, what would have been the potential problems for others, even if the likelihood was small? What were you most worried about? \n\nRisks to the Situation/Relationship\nFinally, what were the risks to the situation if the worst thing happened? Could it have been detrimental to your relationships? Could it have caused problems for other people who weren\u2019t even present? Might there have been safety concerns? What were you worried about? \n\nKeep You Safe\nLook back at the risks that you wrote. How did your Judger mindset try to keep you safe, considering the risks that were possible? \n\nLetter of Gratitude\nNow, considering all that you have realized, write a letter of gratitude to your Judger. Start with \u201cDear Judger,\u201d or whatever name you wish to give to your inner Judger mindset. Acknowledge that its job is to keep you safe and that you recognize how loud it must be to get your attention. Acknowledge that your Judger is part of you and cares about you deeply. Then, let your Judger know (in the letter) that you will listen carefully to the information that the Judger has to share and consider it as you move forward, which does not always mean immediate and instant obedience. While your Judger has ideas, you do not have to instinctively follow what it says, and you may sometimes choose another path forward while still staying safe as your Judger wishes. \nThank your Judger for being there for you and give your Judger a mental hug. \n\nThis tool was created by Lisa Sansom based on materials created by Marilee Adam \n",

Instead you\u2019re engaging in \u201cswitchtasking.\u201d You\u2019re switching back and forth between two activities and forcing your brain to shift focus repeatedly and turn rules on and off in a rapid-fire fashion. Constantly having to focus and re-focus ultimately drains your time and energy, which impacts your overall performance. \n\nHere\u2019s an interesting experiment to try if you still feel like to you can perform two thinking tasks at once and experience no performance issues. \n\nActivity #1 Grab a stopwatch and open Microsoft Word. Start the timer and then type your first and last name. Beneath your name, type a number for each letter in your name (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) Stop the timer and record your time. In my case, this means I would type \u201cScott Blades\u201d on the first line and then type \u201c1234567891011\u201d beneath it. My time for this activity? Nine seconds. \n\nActivity #2 Rather than type your name first and then type the numbers second, try to do both at the same time. On the first line, type the first letter of your name. Then type 1 on the second line. Next type the second letter of your name on the first line, 2 beneath it, and so forth. When I tried doing both of these simple cognitive tasks simultaneously, it took me [drum roll] 51 seconds! That\u2019s more than 5 times longer than when I did the tasks separately and back to back., via The Multitasking Mirage\nScott Blades, M.Ed.",

A different person with the same high-level desire might have a completely different North Star, extrapolated graph, or indicator. That enables us to get real about how aligned we actually are, which can lead to actual alignment.\n-It forces us to get real about our collective strategies and efforts and to ask, \u201cWhat will it take to get us to our North Star?\u201d\n-It starts building a more data-informed culture\n-These graphs could eventually serve as the basis of a collective dashboard, which would enable groups to track their progress over time\n\nSome design implications:\n-You can do this exercise without preparation.

Why don\u2019t you take a moment to close your eyes and turn your attention inside to the place that feels bad (misunderstood, hurt, mad, betrayal, etc.) Take a moment to hold that feeling gently, tenderly like a baby, make room for it in your heart, offer it warmth and curiosity about how it may unfold as you attend to it.\u201d \n\nThen ask for a report from each person. Discourage any kind of cross conversation when they are dysregulated, but ask what came up for them internally, thoughts, feelings, images, sensations in their body, impulses, etc.\nYou can ask them to continue to stay with whatever their experience is and allow it to lead them to whatever wants to come next.

Walk around with your card and say it to other people.\nOn the listening side, offer a guess at what need they meet through doing that.\nDo this 3 times and then switch cards with someone else, keep going until you\u2019ve tried out 3-4 different cards.\n-Danny Cohen\n\nDebrief/Process:\nWhat was insightful about this?\nHow was it to be met in this way?\nHow does focusing on the need change your experience?\n(You can anticipate the objection that people don\u2019t want to condone, support, or accept these behaviors. We can affirm this by sharing how we can accept the need (the beautiful longing motivating the action), without accepting the behavior. The behavior is a strategy and not all strategies are beautiful or legitimate, because some of them don\u2019t take into account other needs. eg I can accept and appreciate, even connect with someone\u2019s longing for calm, comfort, ease, and relief (needs), without supporting the behavior of smoking (strategy) because it doesn\u2019t care for health and sustainability.\nOr in a more severe instance, I can really appreciate a teenager\u2019s longing for belonging and inclusion (needs), while holding a strong \u2018No\u2019 to a strategy of murder (which is called for in some gang contexts to become part of the gang). Or I can appreciate someone\u2019s need for safety and choice, while not supporting the freedom for people to own automatic weapons (because that strategy doesn\u2019t care for other people\u2019s need for safety). (there will probably be questions and reflections here where people are clarifying their understanding of needs, offering challenges \u2018what about this situation?\u2019 Usually it takes time for people to get the distinction between needs and strategies.)",

I watch as they flail, some giving up altogether and waiting out the time, unable to sustain 60 seconds of this kind of reflection. This inability is not benign, and it certainly is not innocent. Suggesting that whiteness has no meaning creates an alienating \u2013 even hostile \u2013 climate for people of color working and living in predominantly white environments, and it does so in several ways.\nIf I cannot tell you what it means to be white, I cannot understand what it means not to be white. I will be unable to bear witness to, much less affirm, an alternate racial experience. I will lack the critical thinking and skills to navigate racial tensions in constructive ways. This creates a culture in which white people assume that niceness is the answer to racial inequality and people of color are required to maintain white comfort in order to survive.\nAn inability to grapple with racial dynamics with any nuance or complexity is ubiquitous in younger white people who have been raised according to an ideology of colorblindness.\"\n--WHITE PEOPLE ASSUME NICENESS IS THE ANSWER TO RACIAL INEQUALITY.

      "name": "Brief Encounters- Pandyas & Chispas-- Cross-Cultural Norms\nhttp://www.acadiau.ca/~dreid/games/Game_descriptions/Brief_Encounters.htm\n\nDescription by Andrea MacGregor\nGrade Level: 8-12\nTime Required: 60-80 minutes\n\nOverview:\n\nEveryone has a culture. It shapes how we see ourselves, others, and the world.\nBehavior is affected in large part by cultural beliefs and values.\nCulture is like an iceberg. Some aspects are visible; others are beneath the surface. Invisible aspects influence and cause the visible ones.\nObjectives:\n\nStudents will gain skills in observing and describing behaviors.\nStudents will develop an understanding of how our cultural values influence the way we view other groups.\nMaterials:\n\nCultural-norms sheets (below) for the Pandya and Chispa cultures (half of the players will receive Pandya sheets and the other half Chispa sheets)\nRecorded music\nIntroduction\n\nScience fiction fans will recognize a familiar theme as they participate in this simulation. Many science fiction authors have explored how humans will behave when we meet an alien race for the first time. \ufffdBrief Encounters\ufffd brings the question closer to home and asks students to explore the interaction of two cultures\ufffdone outgoing and casual, the other more reserved and formal\ufffdwith different social norms.\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Remove all furniture from the center of the classroom. Students will need space to move around. Explain to the class that they will adopt the cultures of two unfamiliar groups, interact with each other, and then examine their reactions.\n\n2. Divide the participants into three groups. Two groups should be about the same size and should have roughly equal numbers of males and females, if possible. A smaller group of two or three students will act as observers.\n\n3. Ask the observers to watch closely as two different cultural groups\ufffdthe Pandyas and the Chispas\ufffdinteract. They may move among the participants, but they may not touch or speak to them. Their observations will help the class view the lesson with a wider perspective during debriefing.\n\n4. Send the Pandya and Chispa groups to opposite corners of the room. Distribute copies of the Pandya cultural-norms sheets to one group and the Chispa cultural-norms sheets to the other group. Ask the members of each culture to read these sheets and to discuss their norms among themselves.\n\n5. Visit the Pandyas and clarify their values. Emphasize the importance of staying in character. Emphasize that the male students should be chaperoned at all times. Remind them of the Pandyas\ufffd reluctance to initiate contacts with people of other cultures.\n\n6. Visit the Chispas and clarify their values. Emphasize the importance of making several brief contacts rather than a few lengthy ones. Define a contact as eliciting a verbal or a nonverbal response from a member of the other culture. Remind them of their friendly, outgoing nature and their eagerness to meet people from other cultures.\n\n7. The simulation: Announce that the two student groups from imaginary countries have been invited to a party sponsored by an international student-exchange organization. The party organizers hope the two groups will get acquainted and learn about each other. When students return to their home schools, they will present culture reports to their classmates. The students are welcome to mingle, dance, and talk.\n\n8. Start the music and let the two cultures interact. The teacher and student observers should walk among the groups, looking for behaviors that can be described and discussed during debriefing.\n\n9. After 10 to 12 minutes, call time and end the party. Ask the students to meet once more in opposite corners of the room and to make notes for their culture reports.\n\n10. Give each group about 10 minutes to create a brief report. The Chispas\ufffd report will describe Pandya behavior and the values that their classmates could expect to encounter if they visited the Pandya nation. The Pandyas will create a similar description of the Chispas\ufffd culture.\n\n11. Ask a representative from the Chispas to present the group\ufffds report to the class. Then, after providing the Chispas with a copy of the Pandya cultural norms, ask a representative from the Pandyas to read that group\ufffds norms sheet. Ask the Chispas to note how their report compared with the Pandyas\ufffd cultural-norms sheet.\n\n12. Repeat with a Pandya representative sharing the group\ufffds report on the Chispas (and provide the Pandyas with the Chispas\ufffd norm sheet).\n\nDebriefing\n\nUse questions such as the following to guide discussion of how our own cultural biases influence the way we view other groups. Be sure to ask the small group of observers for their views on the participants\ufffd attempts to communicate across cultures and to maintain cultural norms.\n\n1. How did you feel about the behavior of the members of your own group? Of the other group? Did your group\ufffds culture report use positive, negative, or neutral terms to describe the other group?\n\n2. How well did your group members observe the norms of their assigned culture? During the party, what did you do if a member of your culture did not observe a particular norm?\n\n3. What are the real-world advantages of following cultural norms?\n\n4. Ask students to discuss whether they agree or disagree with each of the following statements:\n\nPeople have difficulty describing the behaviors of other groups in non-judgmental terms.\nPeople acquire cultural norms fairly quickly.\nMost of the group\ufffds norms are maintained through peer pressure.\nAmericans tend to feel uncomfortable without eye contact, even though in many parts of the world, eye contact is considered to be rude and impolite.\nThe same behavior can be perceived differently depending on your group\ufffds norms. For example, what appears friendly to Chispas seems pushy to Pandyas.\n5. What are some real-world situations that were illustrated during the game?\n\n6. Pandya women were instructed to speak for the Pandya men. In what real-world situations does one group speak for another?\n\n7. How would the game be different for players if the Pandya men dominated the women?\n\n8. What lessons from this activity would you want to keep in mind if you were going to spend time in an unfamiliar culture?\n\n9. Ask students to list as many examples of cross-cultural experiences as they can. Remind them that not all cross-cultural experiences take place in other countries or between people who speak different languages or come from different racial backgrounds. Attending worship services, for example, with a friend who holds different religious beliefs is a cross-cultural experience. It\ufffds possible that going to a new school or having dinner at the home of a friend from another culture also could be a cross-cultural experience. Brainstorm ideas about what students can do to encourage clear communication in such situations.\n\nTaken from: http://www.peacecorps.gov/wws/bridges/lesson12/printable.html\n\nCultural Norms:\nYou Are a Pandya\nPandya Cultural Norms\n\nPandyas prefer to interact with members of their own culture.\nPandyas do not initiate conversation. They speak only when spoken to.\nPandyas have very formal speech patterns. For example, they always use \ufffdsir\ufffd and \ufffdma\ufffdam.\ufffd\nAmong Pandyas, women have more status than men. Men are chaperoned by Pandya women.\nPandya men avoid eye contact with women from other cultures.\nPandya men do not talk directly to women from other cultures. They respond through their chaperones.\nPandya men can talk to men from other cultures. They can maintain eye contact with men from other cultures.\n \n\n \n\nYou Are a Chispa\nChispa Cultural Norms\nChispas are informal and friendly.\nAmong Chispas, there are no gender roles. Men and women behave the same way.\nChispas are outgoing. They love to make contact with people from other cultures.\nChispa contacts are brief and casual.\nChispas are democratic and call everyone by his or her first name.\nChispas value cross-gender contacts more than same-gender contacts.",

      "name": "\"-any\" & \"-eny\" When Mental Models Mislead Us\nAlphabet soup is an exercise which focuses students to think about the managerial decision process, and the limits to how we analyze complex problems. The key points are that managers deal with complex problems, and often use cognitive frameworks to help constrain the problems. These frameworks tell the managers what information is needed; however, unless the managers understand that all frameworks have limitations, these frameworks can fall trap to cognitive biases.\n\nPreparation:\n1. Write on the board: \u201cPlease do not speak unless called upon\u201d\n2. Write on the board: \u201c_any\u201d\n3. Ask the class to raise their hands when they have thought of a single letter which makes \u201c_any\u201d into a word.\n4. Call on a student who raised their hand early. Ask him or her to say the word. Usually, most will say \u201cm\u201d for \u201cmany\u201d, although \u201cz\u201d for \u201czany\u201d is in some dictionaries.\n5. Now, repeat the \u201cPlease do not speak unless called upon\u201d request.\nWrite on the board: \u201c_eny\u201d\n6. Again, ask the students to raise their hands when they have thought of a single letter which makes \u201c_eny\u201d into a word.\n7. Wait a while then look at a student who has not raised their hand. Ask if the student has a letter, but don\u2019t tell you what the letter is. If the student does not have a letter, then ask how they are trying to solve this \u201ccomplex\u201d problem. The student may either be trying letters at random (an unstructured solution) or using the alphabet.\n8. Suggest the alphabet as a way of framing this problem. Go through the alphabet with the student, having the student say the word after you say the alphabet (a, any, b, beny \u2026). Make sure you go to at least \u201cm\u201d, and that you do \u201cd\u201d rather quickly.\n9. After going trying the alphabet, ask a student which raised his/her hand what letter they came up with. After they say \u201cd\u201d for \u201cdeny\u201d, look at the student which said \u201cDenny\u201d. Ask the student why she/he said \u201cDenny\u201d rather than \u201cdeny\u201d\u2014is it possible she/he likes the food at this restaurant?\n10. Make the point of the exercise.\nDiscussion Questions\nIs it better to use a framework or approach a problem using brain storming (random idea generation)?\nWhat are the advantages of a random approach to problem solving? What are the disadvantages?\nWhy did the majority of the class  pronounce \u201cdeny\u201d as \u201cDenny\u201d? How did the \u201cmany\u201d example set-up this cognitive bias?\nIs the alphabet a flawed tool (framework)? Or is it that we forgot that a limit to the alphabet is that many letters have different sounds and pronunciations?\nWhat lessons  does this exercise have what lessons does this exercise have for a manager is faced with a complex problem?\nKey Lecture Points\nThis is a class which uses tools or frameworks to foster analysis of complex problems.\nEvery tool or framework is designed to solve certain types of problems, and has limits to their usefulness. These tools make certain assumptions. Similar to a road map, in order to use these tools certain details have to be omitted from the problem in order for us to comprehend (bounded rationality) the problem.\nThe manager/student must know the limits to the tools or frameworks that they use.\nFinally, this exercise starts a discussion on typical managerial biases (e.g., using an inappropriate analogy, prior hypothesis, escalating commitment, representativeness, illusion of control, allowing framing to bias the decision, overemphasizing selected data) and ways to lessen the impact of these biases (e.g., using frameworks\u2014but know their limits, devil\u2019s advocate, use multiple frameworks, consider improbable or unpopular assumptions, re-evaluate your decisions and analyses over time).\nContributed by Don Hatfield\nhttps://carpenterstrategytoolbox.com/2012/07/23/alphabet-soup-exploring-cognitive-frames/\n",

      "name": "Critical Listening (Mickey Mouse vs Winnie the Pooh candidates)\nAuthor: Barbara A. Penington, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Communication Department University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, Whitewater, WI 53190 peningtb@uww.edu 262-472-1034\nType/Aspect of listening in focus: Critical Listening, Fallacies of Reasoning, Propaganda, Political Communication\nCourses: Listening, Public Speaking, and any other classes that emphasize critical listening skills.\nAge Level: High school, College (possibly high achieving middle school students)\nGoal: To introduce fallacies of reasoning and propaganda devices so that students gain practice in becoming more effective critical listeners especially when listening to political messages.\nAspect of Listening: Critical Listening\nDescription: Critical listening is considered an upper level listening skill because it goes beyond simply understanding a message to, as Wolvin and Coakley (1996) suggest, listening to evaluate the merits of that message. As such, the critical listener becomes mentally immersed in the message and draws upon critical thinking skills to analyze, synthesize, apply and/or evaluate the language and related behavior of the communication source.\nToday more than ever before, individuals are called upon to utilize effective critical listening when they are exposed to political messages that may come to them through television, radio, the internet or even cell phones. Critical listening should be an essential component of the educational process as the development of skills in this area, serve to ensure that teenagers and young adults will become informed and responsible citizens.\nUnfortunately, advertisers and political strategists are aware that many people will not listen as critically to their messages as they should. Fallacies of reasoning, such as \u2015hasty generalizations\u2016 or \u2015ad hominem\u2016 arguments are sometimes strategically used in political campaigns to sway voters from one candidate or cause to another. Propaganda devices such as \u2015name-calling\u2016 or using a \u2015bandwagon\u2016 plea (everyone is doing it) often interfere with a critical appraisal of political information because they are easy to miss if one is not listening critically.\nThe following group activity gives students practice in critical listening by having them detect fallacies of reasoning and propaganda devices in political messages. Instead of starting with actual political speeches, however, this activity uses fictional Disney characters who are candidates for the office of \u2015President\u2016 of Disney World.\tSmall groups of students choose a Disney character and write a political speech where they must strategically use at least four fallacies of reasoning or propaganda devices, to support their character while working to minimize support for their opponents. One member of each student group is selected to\nListening Education 2/2010 \u00a9 International Listening Association, www.listen.org\n20present their Disney candidate\u2018s speech while students in other groups record the fallacies or propaganda devices they hear.\nPreparation and Procedure:\nTime: The activity takes approximately 75 minutes. It can be done in two shorter class periods if need be (explanation of the group project and writing the speech on Day 1; presentation of the speeches and class discussion on the Day 2).\nSteps in the Process:\n1.\n2.\n3.\nReview critical listening, especially its definition and importance. Be sure to discuss the times when students might be most likely to use critical listening skills. For this activity, emphasize that as students decide on political candidates or causes to support, they must listen critically to campaign speeches, testimonials from supportive others, and campaign advertisements. Political strategists \u2015bank\u2016 on people not listening carefully and critically to a message, so they occasionally, either intentionally or unintentionally, incorporate fallacies of reasoning or propaganda devices into their messages to garner greater support for their candidate or cause.\nIntroduce fallacies of reasoning and propaganda devices. I generally do this using a handout or power point presentation where I give a definition and its accompanying example. I primarily use Wolvin and Coakley\u2018s (1996) definitions found on pages 331-342. I typically use the following devices (but you can delete items or expand the list as you see fit):\na.\tHasty Generalization: Drawing unwarranted or general conclusions from an insufficient number of cases (p. 33l)\nb. Ignoring the Issue (Ad Hominem argument): Attacking the personal character of the opponent rather than focusing on the content of the issue itself (p. 334)\nc.\tName Calling: Attaching an unfavorable or undesirable label to a person, object or event to encourage disapproval or rejection (p. 341).\nd.\tGlittering Generality: attaching a vague but virtuous-sounding label to a person object or event to cause automatic approval (p. 341).\ne. Transfer: associating positive qualities of a respected/revered person or group with a person or event (p. 342).\nf.\tPlain Folks Appeal: Trying to identify with the audience by adopting the language, dress or behavior of the listeners (p. 342)\ng.\tCard Stacking: manipulating (withholding, ignoring, over/under emphasizing) evidence of the opposing viewpoint and giving only the evidence that supports your viewpoint (p. 342).\nh.\tBandwagon: Using phrases or statements to suggest \u2015everyone is doing it (p.342).\u2016\ni.\tTestimonials: Using the opinion of some well-known person to support one\u2018s view. Often the person who is speaking is famous, but not necessarily knowledgeable on the issue (Brownell, 2006, p. 256).\nWhen students have a basic understanding of the fallacies and devices, I divide them into 4-5 groups of about 5-6 members each. I glue pictures of about eight different\nListening Education 2/2010 \u00a9 International Listening Association, www.listen.org\n21\nDisney characters to long paint stir sticks to resemble political signs or placards. The stir sticks are available at hardware stores or where ever paint is sold. I have also purchased Disney coloring books and color the faces of the characters I will use, cut them out, and then glue them to the sticks. Here are some possibilities of Disney characters you might use:\na.\tMickey Mouse b.\tMinnie Mouse c. Goofy d.\tDonald Duck e.\tGeorge of the Jungle f.\tWinnie the Pooh\ng. Tigger h. Eyore i. Aladdin j.\tJiminy Cricket k.\tSnow White...and the list is endless!\nI let each group choose their candidate from the possible choices. I then list on the board all of the candidates that are \u2015running for office.\u2016 I usually assign one candidate to run against one other candidate rather than having each candidate run against four or five others. That can get quite complicated.\nThe groups get from 20-30 minutes to write a campaign speech for their Disney candidate. To help them out, I also develop short information sheets on each candidate (you can use Google or even Wikipedia to get a brief history and description of each character). Groups get information on their candidate as well as their opponent to help them craft their political speeches. The goal is for each group to develop a political speech where they incorporate at least four fallacies of reasoning/ propaganda devices.\n4.\tWhen the speech has been written, each group selects one member to deliver the speech to the entire class from a podium at the front of the classroom.\n5.\tDuring the delivery, students who are not in that particular group must record the fallacies of reasoning/propaganda devices that they hear.\n6.\tFollowing each group\u2018s presentation, we discuss the fallacies of reasoning/propaganda devices that students have heard.\n7.\tThis continues until all groups are done.\nExample: Excerpt from an actual speech written by a group in a college class: Candidate: Mickey Mouse Opponent: Winnie the Pooh Mickey speaking:\nListening Education 2/2010 \u00a9 International Listening Association, www.listen.org\n22\nThank you, everyone, for coming out today. And thank you, Minnie, for that gracious introduction. Although Minnie introduced me as Mitchell Mouse, I\u2019m sure you can see by the way I\u2019m dressed that I\u2019m a down-to earth-kind of guy-- so if you call me \u201cMickey\u201d or even \u201cMick\u201d that is way cool with me.\nFrom that first day long ago when I met the intelligent and kind-hearted Walt Disney, he was certain that I would be a great asset to the world of politics. It was on that day that we began a journey that I hope will end in me serving as your President. Although I very much like my opponent, Winnie the Pooh (and I am sure some of you do as well, I have to wonder if you really want someone to lead you who is constantly daydreaming about honey and wandering around Hundred Acre Wood? Do you really want an incapable buffoon in office who can\u2019t even figure out how to get his hand out of a honey jar or escape a swarm of bees?\nI, on the other hand, have graduated second in my class at Holey Swiss High School. I have years of experience being the Executive Officer in my marriage to Minnie, and I am currently working night and day to build a state-of-the-art amusement park so it can employ all of my good friends who live in the Disney World area. The talented and exciting Oprah supports me as does her good friend, television personality, Dr. Phil.\nSo to sum up my message today, voting for me is voting for a real winner. Voting for Mickey Mouse, will put you in the company of hundreds of others who have already wished upon a star and know that all their dreams will come true--when I become elected to this prestigious office.\nAdditional Tips and Debriefing:\nThis fun and non-threatening activity encourages students to use their critical listening skills as they become more familiar with fallacies of reasoning and propaganda devices they hear in politically-oriented messages. The instructor can extend this activity by having students view a real political advertisement or campaign speech and apply the critical listening skills they have been practicing. Showing students infomercials and having them apply critical listening skills is another creative way to extend the exercise.\nAssessment:\nInformal assessment occurs as students share the fallacies of reasoning and propaganda devices they have heard during their peers\u2018 campaign speeches, and the instructor assesses the accuracy of their observations. Assessment could also occur if the instructor chooses a current political message for students to analyze for fallacies of reasoning/propaganda devices. Finally, a quiz could be given or a section of an exam devoted to asking questions geared to assess understanding of critical listening, fallacy of reasoning and propaganda devices.\nReferences:\nBrownell, J.

You may have to try several times.  It takes some skill but is easy to learn. Even young children can enjoy it.  Once successful, complications are minimal.  Birds seldom get too close. Rain, however, soaks in very fast. Too many people doing the same thing can also cause problems. One needs lots of room. If there are no complications it can be very peaceful. A rock will serve as an anchor. If things break loose from it, however, you will not get a second chance.\nLaundry\nThe procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange things into groups. Of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities, that is the next step; otherwise you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. In the short run this may not seem important, but complications can arise. A mistake can prove expensive as well. At first the whole procedure will seem complicated. Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to foresee any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but one can never tell. After the procedure is completed, one arranges the materials into different groups again. Then they can be put into their appropriate places.  Eventually they will all be used once more, and the whole cycle will have to be repeated.  However, that is part of life.\nCandy & Crayons experiment (Wimmer & Perner, 1983, \u201cCurse of Knowledge\u201d)\n-child (\u201cJohn\u201d) walks into a room w a box labeled \u201ccandy\u201d\n-box actually has crayons\n-another child (\u201cMary\u201d) enters the room, and John is asked what Mary thinks is in the box.

They devised a business letter that contained some errors and asked 13 male and 11 female college students to role-play delivering criticism under two scenarios. In the first, the speaker was a boss talking to a subordinate; in the second, the speaker was a subordinate talking to his or her boss. The researchers measured how hard the speakers tried to avoid hurting the feelings of the person they were criticizing.\n\nOne might expect people to be more careful about how they deliver criticism when they are in a subordinate position. Tracy and Eisenberg found that hypothesis to be true for the men in their study but not for the women. As they reported in Research on Language and Social Interaction (Volume 24, 1990/1991), the women showed more concern about the other person\u2019s feelings when they were playing the role of superior. In other words, the women were more careful to save face for the other person when they were managing down than when they were managing up. This pattern recalls the way girls are socialized: Those who are in some way superior are expected to downplay rather than flaunt their superiority.\n\nIn my own recordings of workplace communication, I observed women talking in similar ways. For example, when a manager had to correct a mistake made by her secretary, she did so by acknowledging that there were mitigating circumstances. She said, laughing, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s hard to do things around here, isn\u2019t it, with all these people coming in!\u201d The manager was saving face for her subordinate, just like the female students role-playing in the Tracy and Eisenberg study.\n\nIs this an effective way to communicate? One must ask, effective for what? The manager in question established a positive environment in her group, and the work was done effectively. On the other hand, numerous women in many different fields told me that their bosses say they don\u2019t project the proper authority.\"",

Typically, one is described as much more cautious, the other much more willing to experiment. I ask the two volunteers their experiences of bumping into a chair (which they have often given voice to during the exercise), and the cautious one reliably says that it was frustrating, while the other volunteer says something along the lines of it being exciting.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: \nWhen I go outside, I hand each volunteer a goal, and the goals are different, unbeknownst to everyone else.\n1.\tTry to get to the other side of the room as \u201csafely\u201d and efficiently as possible.\n2.\tAs you move to the other side of the room, try to develop as complete a map as possible, bumping into at least 4 chairs on the way.\n\nThe purpose of the exercise is chiefly to show that, when operating under high uncertainty, \u201cdiscovery\u201d goals tend to encourage much greater experimentation and much better performance than typical outcome goals. Discovery goals help us create mental models that reduce the uncertainty, moving us back to a place where typical outcome goals are helpful again. Discovery necessitates experimentation and making \u201cmistakes,\u201d and the permission to do so is experienced as liberating (because it\u2019s inevitable).\n\n2 keys\n1.\tObservers seeing the difference in behavior that is actually shaped by the goal framing\n2.\tParticipants\u2019 emotional experience that is actually shaped by the goal framing\n\n\nWebinar Adaptation\nGoals\n1.

      "name": "Clear, Shady, & No Mirrors: Explore the Gun Powder Triggered Inside You\n-from Zainab Salbi, http://zainabsalbi.com/babble/another-perspective/\n\"Angeles Arrien, a great teacher and mentor, pointed out in her anthropological work of indigenous cultures around the world how \u201cevery person is a mirror of some aspect of our own nature\u201d and how \u201cwe are all mirrors for each other.\u201d She identified the mirrors as \u201cclear,\u201d \u201cshady,\u201d and the \u201cno mirrors.\u201d Clear mirrors are those who bring the best out of you, lift your spirits, and bring you joy when you are with them. Shady mirrors are those who irritate and annoy you, or those who you are sexually attracted to.  No mirrors are those who you do not notice no matter how many times you encounter them. In Arrien\u2019s retreats, which I had the privilege of attending several times, she has everyone sit in a circle and asks all participants to practice direct conversation with the person who holds any kind of mirror to them. If one is a shady mirror in terms of irritation, she asks us to identify what aspect of ourselves did this other person touched within us. And instead of blaming the other person, one needs to acknowledge that the person who represents a \u201cshady mirror\u201d only triggered this because it exists within you.  All of this had to be done by going to the person and having the courage to communicate this to them honestly, without blame, in front of the whole community of retreat attendees.\n\nYou can imagine that this is not an easy conversation. Silence is usually held for a long time and each person has to confront their own discomfort with the idea of having to acknowledge their own story instead of scapegoating the other.  Even those who are sexually attracted to another person are asked to have this honest conversation by acknowledging their attraction to the person, thanking them for triggering this feeling within their heart. And if they are not available, they are released from all desire to respond or act.  Just the confrontation of that in an honest way releases all tension and drama, which are usually triggered when there is sexual attraction and when there is no honest conversation around it.\n\nArrien proves many points with this exercise. One truth is that there is no obsolete definition for any one person as good or bad.  It is impossible for one person to be loved by all or hated by all. Instead, everyone holds mirrors that trigger different things in each other. So the same person can be loved by some and hated by others.  This can\u2019t be a sole reflection of the person. A large part of that is the mirror this person holds for others around them. This is an exercise of utter self-responsibility, of seeing oneself from another perspective, of having to confront even uncomfortable subjects we often prefer to hide. But it is also an exercise of liberation from self-righteousness. It is a step towards walking the path of humility and compassion towards the self. And in understanding oneself fully, you understand others around you.\"",

But what we're not seeing is that this presentation is hiding deeply low self-esteem,\u201d says Foster. \u201cThink of the actual size of Narcissus' ego as a peanut. It\u2019s fragile and easy to crush. To protect it, Narcissus takes that little peanut, drops it in a balloon and blows that balloon up as big possible to create a \u2018decoy ego.\u2019 He fills the room with himself and keeps everybody away from that peanut at all costs. What I love about this analogy is that balloons are inherently fragile. One pop and it's immediately right sized. And that's what\u2019s happening with Narcissus.\u201d\n\nFor those who work with a Narcissus, keep in mind this balloon imagery. \u201cAlways keep in your mind that Narcissus is keeping that balloon full. It's a very hard way to live, getting that balloon puffed up and guarding it all the time,\u201d says Foster. \u201cWe can try to have a little empathy for what she has to go through. Find opportunities to be kind and to give her some positive feedback in the context of the collective, such as a team or company.
